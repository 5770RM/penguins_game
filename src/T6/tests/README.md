# Testing documentation #

We performed 1000 tests of intercative mode, the results we obtained can be found in **test_results.txt** and each of the gameplays in text file in **folder games**.

To run test, first they need to build them with `./build`.
Then `./run n`, where n is the number of test you want to perform.
